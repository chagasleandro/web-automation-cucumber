## Introduction

This project is designed to automate web application testing using Cucumber, a tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD), and Selenium WebDriver for browser automation. It provides a simple, readable format for writing test scenarios and integrates well with Java.

## Features

- **Behavior Driven Development**: Write tests in a human-readable format using Gherkin syntax.
- **Web Automation**: Automate interactions with web applications using Selenium WebDriver.
- **Page Object Model**: Organized code structure to separate test logic from page-specific details.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new steps and page objects to extend functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Java 8 or higher**: Ensure Java is installed and properly set up on your machine.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and project build.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation (included via Maven dependencies).
- **Cucumber**: For defining and executing BDD test cases (included via Maven dependencies).

## Setup
